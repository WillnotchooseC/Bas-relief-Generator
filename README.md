# Bas-relief-Generator
 This is a C++ project by using Eigen Lib. 
 This project take 3D model file (OFF file) as input then generate corresponding bas-relief from front perspective.
 If you want to run my code, just simply download it then remember import Eigen lib to your IDE then put your OFF file in the same folder as the code. After that, you can run my code to see the bas-relief.
